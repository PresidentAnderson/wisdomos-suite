## 🏗️ Architecture Delivered

```
Life Areas (Domain)
    ↓ [Expandable]
Subdomains (Creative/Operational/Strategic)
    ↓ [Expandable]
Five Dimensions (Being/Doing/Having/Relating/Becoming)
    ↓ [Interactive Table]
Practices, Inquiries, Metrics (1-5 scale)
```

## 🚄 Speed Optimization

**Strategy:** Parallel Agent Deployment

**Execution:**
- Deployed 3 agents simultaneously
- Agent 1: Type definitions + Sample data
- Agent 2: DimensionTable component
- Agent 3: FulfillmentDisplayV5 component + Page

**Results:**
- Traditional sequential: ~12-15 minutes estimated
- Parallel agents: **4 minutes actual**
- **Speed gain: 3-4x faster** ⚡

## 🎨 Features Implemented

### Three-Tier Expandable UI
✅ Life Areas expand to show Subdomains
✅ Subdomains expand to show Five Dimensions
✅ Smooth animations with Framer Motion
✅ Animated chevrons (rotate on expand/collapse)

### Status Indicators
✅ Color-coded status (Green/Yellow/Red)
✅ Dynamic icons (CheckCircle, AlertTriangle, TrendingUp)
✅ Status backgrounds with borders

### Five-Dimension Matrix
✅ Interactive table with all 5 dimensions
✅ Editable metrics (1-5 scale)
✅ Color-coded metrics (green 4-5, yellow 3, red 1-2)
✅ Inline editing with save/cancel
✅ Displays focus, inquiry, practices, notes

### Context Cards
✅ "What's Working" cards (green background)
✅ "No Longer Tolerated" cards (red background)
✅ Displayed at Life Area level when expanded

## 💡 Technical Highlights

**Parallel Agent Deployment:**
```
Agent 1 (Haiku) → Types + Data      }
Agent 2 (Haiku) → DimensionTable    } → 4 minutes total
Agent 3 (Haiku) → Main Component    }
```

**TypeScript Type Safety:**
```typescript
LifeArea → Subdomain[] → Dimension[] → Metric (1-5)
```

**State Management:**
```typescript
expandedAreas: Set<string>       // O(1) lookups
expandedSubdomains: Set<string>  // O(1) lookups
```

**Animation Strategy:**
```typescript
<AnimatePresence>
  <motion.div
    initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }}
    exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
  />
</AnimatePresence>
```
