## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Server Components:** All pages are async server components
- **Client Components:** Only interactive UI (filters, forms)
- **Data Fetching:** Prisma queries with proper relations
- **State Management:** URL params for filters
- **Images:** Next.js Image optimization
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom gradients

### Database Queries
```typescript
// Service list with filters
searchServices({ query, categoryId, minPrice, maxPrice, sortBy, page, limit })

// Service detail with relations
prisma.service.findUnique({
  include: { provider, category, media, reviews, _count }
})

// Provider with services and reviews
prisma.provider.findUnique({
  include: { user, services, _count }
})
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Proper loading states
- Pagination to limit query size
- Indexed database fields
- Component code splitting
