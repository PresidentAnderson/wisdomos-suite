## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Fetching
- **Server Components:** All pages use async server components for optimal performance
- **Prisma Queries:** Complex queries with nested includes for related data
- **Dynamic Rendering:** All pages set `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

### URL State Management
- Search params used for filter state
- Pagination via URL query params
- Bookmarkable URLs with active filters
- Browser back/forward support

### Database Queries Used
```typescript
// Service list with filters
searchServices(filters) // Existing function

// Service detail with full relations
prisma.service.findUnique({
  include: {
    provider: { include: { user } },
    category: true,
    media: true,
    reviews: { include: { buyer: { include: { user } } } },
    _count: { select: { bookings, reviews } }
  }
})

// Provider profile with services and reviews
prisma.provider.findUnique({
  include: {
    user: true,
    services: { include: { category, _count } },
    _count: { select: { services, bookings } }
  }
})

// All reviews for provider
prisma.review.findMany({
  where: { service: { providerId } },
  include: { buyer: { include: { user } }, service }
})
```

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Grid layouts adjust: 1 col (mobile) → 2 cols (tablet) → 3 cols (desktop)
- Sticky sidebar on desktop, stacked on mobile

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- Alt text for all images
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
