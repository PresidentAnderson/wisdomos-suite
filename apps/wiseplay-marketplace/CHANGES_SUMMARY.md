# Vercel Deployment Fix - Changes Summary

## Date
October 30, 2025

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: "No Next.js version detected. Make sure your package.json has 'next' in either 'dependencies' or 'devDependencies'"

## Root Cause
Vercel was running install from monorepo root but looking for Next.js in the wrong package.json location.

## Solution
Set Vercel Root Directory to `apps/wiseplay-marketplace` and update vercel.json to use npm with explicit commands.

---

## Files Changed

### 1. vercel.json
**Location**: `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/vercel.json`

**Before**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm install && cd packages/database && pnpm db:generate && cd ../../apps/wiseplay-marketplace && pnpm build",
  "installCommand": "cd ../.. && pnpm install",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "devCommand": "pnpm dev",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npx prisma generate && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Simplified install command (no more `cd ../..`)
- Uses npm instead of pnpm (better for standalone app deployment)
- Build command includes prisma generate
- Removed monorepo navigation complexity

---

### 2. DEPLOYMENT.md
**Location**: `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Changes**:
- Added explicit instructions to set Root Directory
- Added troubleshooting section for "No Next.js version detected" error
- Clarified importance of Root Directory setting

## Critical Configuration Required

### Vercel Dashboard Settings

**MUST SET** in Project Settings → General:

```
Root Directory: apps/wiseplay-marketplace
```

Without this setting, the deployment will fail with the Next.js detection error.

---

## Environment Variables Required

Add these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=6
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

---

## Verification Steps

### Local Testing
```bash
cd apps/wiseplay-marketplace
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run build
```

All commands should succeed without errors.

### Vercel Testing
1. Set Root Directory to `apps/wiseplay-marketplace`
2. Add environment variables
3. Deploy
4. Check build logs for:
   - "Next.js detected" message
   - Successful Prisma Client generation
   - Successful build completion

---

## What This Fixes

✅ Next.js version detection
✅ Framework preset recognition
✅ Prisma Client generation
✅ Build command execution
✅ Module resolution
✅ Monorepo deployment issues

---

## How It Works

1. **Install Phase**: Vercel runs `npm install` from `apps/wiseplay-marketplace` directory
2. **Build Phase**:
   - Runs `npx prisma generate` to create Prisma Client
   - Runs `npm run build` to build Next.js app
3. **Framework Detection**: Vercel finds `next` in package.json dependencies
4. **Deploy**: App deployed to Vercel Edge network

---

## Testing Results

- ✅ Prisma generate works locally with `npx prisma generate`
- ✅ Package.json has Next.js 14.2.18 in dependencies
- ✅ vercel.json configuration is valid
- ✅ Schema exists at `prisma/schema.prisma`
- ✅ All required dependencies present

---

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Configure Vercel Project**:
   - Set Root Directory to `apps/wiseplay-marketplace`
   - Add all environment variables

2. **Deploy**:
   - Push to main branch OR
   - Click Deploy in Vercel dashboard

3. **Verify**:
   - Check build logs
   - Test app at deployment URL
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Test Stripe integration

---

## Support

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify Root Directory setting is correct
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Review DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed troubleshooting
5. Check that DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel

---

## Files You Need to Review

Before deploying, review these files:

1. ✅ `vercel.json` - Build configuration
2. ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies (Next.js present)
3. ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
4. ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variables template
5. ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full deployment guide

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ App loads at deployment URL
- ✅ Database connections work
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ Stripe integration functional
- ✅ No runtime errors in logs

---

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. Revert vercel.json changes
2. Contact support with build logs
3. Check troubleshooting in DEPLOYMENT.md
