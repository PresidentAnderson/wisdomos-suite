## Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: File-based Routing with Next.js App Router
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted
**Context:**
- Need to implement 9 distinct settings pages
- Want clean URLs and easy navigation
- Prefer type-safe routing

**Decision:**
Use Next.js 14 App Router with file-based routing structure:
```
app/settings/
├── layout.tsx
├── notifications/page.tsx
├── account/page.tsx
├── profile/page.tsx
├── security/page.tsx
├── privacy/page.tsx
├── integrations/page.tsx
├── accessibility/page.tsx
└── feedback/page.tsx
```

**Rationale:**
- Clean URL structure: `/settings/notifications`, `/settings/privacy`, etc.
- Shared layout reduces code duplication
- Automatic code splitting per route
- Type-safe navigation with TypeScript
- SEO-friendly URLs

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single page with tabs (rejected: too monolithic, bad for deep linking)
- Separate apps (rejected: too complex, maintenance overhead)
- Traditional routing library (rejected: Next.js native solution better)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Easy to navigate and bookmark specific settings
- ✅ Better performance with automatic code splitting
- ✅ Consistent layout across all pages
- ⚠️ Slightly more files to manage

**References:**
- [Next.js App Router Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)

### AD-002: Client-side State Management with React useState
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
- Settings pages have local form state
- Need immediate UI feedback
- Want simple, maintainable code

**Decision:**
Use React `useState` for local state management with localStorage for persistence:
```typescript
const [settings, setSettings] = useState<T>(initialState)

// Persist on save
const handleSave = () => {
  localStorage.setItem('wisdomos_settings', JSON.stringify(settings))
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Settings are page-scoped, not global
- No complex state interactions between pages
- localStorage provides temporary persistence until backend integration
- Simpler than Redux/Zustand for this use case
- Easy to migrate to API calls later

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Redux (rejected: overkill for local state)
- Zustand (rejected: unnecessary for isolated pages)
- React Context (rejected: no need to share state across pages)
- URL state (rejected: too much data for URL params)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Simple, easy to understand code
- ✅ Fast development
- ✅ Good performance
- ⚠️ State doesn't persist across sessions (temporary until backend)

**Migration Path:**
Replace localStorage with API calls:
```typescript
const handleSave = async () => {
  await settingsApi.update(settings)
}
```

---

### AD-003: Mock Data for Frontend-First Development
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ⏳ Temporary (Backend pending)

**Context:**
- Backend API not yet available
- Need to complete frontend for review
- Want realistic data for UI testing

**Decision:**
Implement full UI with mock data that matches expected API shape:
```typescript
const [integrations, setIntegrations] = useState<Integration[]>([
  {
    id: 'notion',
    name: 'Notion',
    connected: true,
    lastSync: '2 hours ago'
  }
  // ... more mock data
])
```

**Rationale:**
- Unblocks frontend development
- Allows UI/UX testing without backend
- Easy to replace with real API calls later
- Matches expected backend data structure

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Wait for backend (rejected: blocks progress)
- Use API mocking service (rejected: adds complexity)
- Build minimal backend (rejected: out of scope for frontend)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Frontend complete and testable
- ✅ User can review UI/UX
- ⚠️ Not production-ready without backend
- ⚠️ Need to replace all mock data later

**Migration Checklist:**
- [ ] Replace integrations mock data with API
- [ ] Replace export simulation with real exports
- [ ] Connect feedback form to backend
- [ ] Load accessibility settings from API

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
- Large codebase with multiple developers
- Need to catch errors early
- Want self-documenting code

**Decision:**
Enable TypeScript strict mode and use explicit interfaces:
```typescript
interface Integration {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  icon: any // Only exception for React components
  connected: boolean
  category: 'productivity' | 'communication' | 'storage'
  permissions?: string[]
  lastSync?: string
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Catches errors at compile time
- Better IDE autocomplete
- Self-documenting code

- Necessary because icon components are dynamic

---

### TD-002: localStorage for Temporary Persistence
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ⏳ Temporary

**Context:**
- Backend not yet ready
- Need some persistence for testing
- Want to simulate save functionality

**Decision:**
Use localStorage with namespaced keys:
```typescript

- ✅ Works without backend
- ⚠️ Not secure (client-side only)
- ⚠️ Lost if browser data cleared
- ⚠️ Must migrate to API later

**Migration Plan:**
Replace with API calls:
```typescript
// Before
localStorage.setItem('wisdomos_settings', JSON.stringify(settings))

// After
await fetch('/api/settings', {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify(settings)
})
```

### TD-003: Controlled Components for Forms
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
- Multiple forms with validation
- Need real-time feedback
- Want single source of truth

**Decision:**
Use controlled components with React state:
```typescript
const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState<FeedbackForm>({
  type: 'feature',
  subject: '',
  message: ''
})

<input
  value={feedback.subject}
  onChange={(e) => setFeedback({ ...feedback, subject: e.target.value })}
/>
```

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth
- Easy validation
- Can disable submit until valid
- Good for complex forms

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Uncontrolled components (rejected: harder to validate)
- react-hook-form (deferred: will add later)
- Formik (rejected: heavy, overkill)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Easy to validate

- Custom Portal (rejected: unnecessary complexity)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Good for MVP
- ⚠️ Manual focus management needed
- ⚠️ Should add Radix UI Dialog later

**Future Enhancement:**
```typescript
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog'

<Dialog.Root>
  <Dialog.Trigger>Open</Dialog.Trigger>
  <Dialog.Portal>
    <Dialog.Overlay />
    <Dialog.Content>
      {/* Content with automatic focus management */}
    </Dialog.Content>
  </Dialog.Portal>
</Dialog.Root>
```

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted

**Context:**
- Using localStorage temporarily
- Settings data not highly sensitive
- Backend will store actual data

**Decision:**
Only store UI preferences in localStorage, never:
- Authentication tokens
- Personal information
- OAuth credentials
- Payment information

**Rationale:**
- localStorage is not secure
- XSS attacks can read localStorage
- Settings preferences are low-risk
- Backend will store sensitive data

**Impact:**
- ✅ Safe for temporary use
- ✅ No security risk
- ⚠️ Must migrate to backend

**Security Checklist:**
- [x] No passwords in localStorage
- [x] No tokens in localStorage
- [x] No PII in localStorage
- [x] Only UI preferences stored
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy
- [ ] Add CSRF protection (backend)

---

### SD-002: OAuth Token Storage Strategy
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** 📋 Planned (Backend)

**Context:**
- Integration section needs OAuth
- Must store access/refresh tokens securely
- Tokens give access to user data

**Decision:**
Store OAuth tokens in backend database with encryption:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_integrations (
  access_token TEXT, -- Encrypted at rest
  refresh_token TEXT, -- Encrypted at rest
  token_expires_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Rationale:**
- Never expose tokens to client
- Database encryption at rest
- Can revoke tokens server-side
- Audit token usage

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Client-side storage (rejected: massive security risk)
- Session storage (rejected: still client-side)
- Encrypted cookies (rejected: size limitations)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Secure token storage
- ✅ Can audit and revoke
- ✅ GDPR compliant
- ⚠️ Requires backend implementation

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. Database encryption at rest
2. Token rotation on refresh
3. Revocation on disconnect
4. Audit log for token usage
5. Rate limiting on token requests

---

### SD-003: Rate Limiting Strategy
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** 📋 Planned (Backend)

**Context:**
- Feedback form can be spammed
- Data export is resource-intensive
- Need to prevent abuse

**Decision:**
Implement rate limiting at multiple levels:
```typescript
// Per user limits
{
  'feedback': '10 requests / hour',
  'export': '5 requests / hour',
  'integration-connect': '20 requests / hour'
}

// Global limits
{
  'feedback': '1000 requests / hour',
  'export': '100 requests / hour'
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents abuse and spam
- Protects backend resources
- Fair usage across all users
- Industry standard practice

**Impact:**
- ✅ Protected from abuse
- ✅ Fair resource allocation
- ⚠️ Need good error messages

**Error Handling:**
```typescript
if (response.status === 429) {
  showError('Too many requests. Please try again in 10 minutes.')
}
```

---

## Performance Decisions

### PD-001: Code Splitting by Route
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Accepted (Automatic)

**Context:**
- 9 settings pages with lots of code
- Users typically visit 1-2 pages per session
- Want fast initial load

**Decision:**
Use Next.js automatic code splitting by route:
```
Each page is a separate bundle:
- /settings/notifications → notifications.chunk.js
- /settings/integrations → integrations.chunk.js
```

**Rationale:**
- Automatic with Next.js App Router
- Only load code for current page
- Prefetch on hover for instant navigation
- No extra configuration needed

**Impact:**
- ✅ Faster initial page load
- ✅ Lower bandwidth usage
- ✅ Better caching
- ⚠️ None (automatic optimization)

**Bundle Sizes (estimated):**
- Layout: ~15KB
- Each page: ~20-30KB
- Shared dependencies: ~100KB
- Total initial: ~135KB
- Per route: ~20KB additional

---

### PD-002: Lazy Loading Heavy Components
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** 📋 Future Enhancement

**Context:**
- Some components rarely used
- Modals not needed until opened
- Can defer loading

**Decision:**
Plan to lazy load modals and heavy components:
```typescript
const ExportModal = lazy(() => import('./ExportModal'))

<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  {showModal && <ExportModal />}
</Suspense>
```

**Rationale:**
- Reduces initial bundle size
- Components only load when needed
- Easy to implement incrementally

**Impact:**
- ✅ Smaller initial bundle
- ✅ Faster initial load
- ⚠️ Slight delay on first modal open

**Priority:** Low (Current bundles already small)

---

### PD-003: Optimistic UI Updates
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** 📋 Future Enhancement

**Context:**
- Users expect instant feedback
- Network requests add latency
- Can predict success in most cases

**Decision:**
Plan to implement optimistic updates:
```typescript
const handleToggle = async (key: string) => {
  // Update UI immediately
  setSettings(prev => ({ ...prev, [key]: !prev[key] }))

  try {
    await api.updateSettings(settings)
  } catch (error) {
    // Revert on error
    setSettings(prev => ({ ...prev, [key]: !prev[key] }))
    showError('Update failed')
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Feels instant to user
- Better perceived performance
- Can revert on error

**Impact:**
- ✅ Better UX
- ✅ Feels faster
- ⚠️ Must handle errors well

**Priority:** Medium (After backend integration)

---

- Visible focus indicators (2px solid)
- Focus trap in modals
- Focus return after modal close
- Skip links for main content

```css
/* Focus indicator */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid theme('colors.indigo.500');
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Essential for keyboard navigation
- Required for WCAG compliance

Build settings as single page with tab navigation:
```typescript
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Notifications">...</Tab>
  <Tab label="Account">...</Tab>
  // etc.
</Tabs>
```

**Why Rejected:**
- Poor for deep linking (can't bookmark specific settings)
- Large initial bundle (all pages loaded)
- Harder to code split
- Less SEO friendly
- Worse for mobile (horizontal tabs awkward)

**Decision:**
Use multi-page approach with file-based routing instead.

---

### RA-002: Redux for State Management
