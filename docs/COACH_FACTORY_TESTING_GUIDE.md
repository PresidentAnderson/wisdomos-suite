## üìã Pre-Testing Checklist

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
cd "/Volumes/DevOPS 2025/01_DEVOPS_PLATFORM/wisdomOS 2026"

# Apply the Coach Factory migration
supabase db push

# Or execute directly:
supabase db execute --file supabase/migrations/20251030_coach_factory_schema.sql
```

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('coach_factory_config', 'coach_sessions_extended', 'fulfillment_signals', 'we_assessment_triggers');

-- Check coach configs seeded (should return 30)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coach_factory_config;

-- Check all 30 life areas
SELECT life_area_id, coach_name FROM coach_factory_config ORDER BY life_area_id;
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your deployment URL
```

### 3. Start Development Server

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test 1: Voice Recording & Transcription
**Objective**: Verify basic Phoenix Wisdom Coach functionality

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/wisdom-coach` or wherever VoiceCoach is mounted
2. Click the microphone button to start recording
3. Speak a reflection about work (30-60 seconds):
   ```
   "I've been feeling really stressed at work lately. The new project is overwhelming
   and I'm working 12-hour days. I feel like I'm losing my work-life balance and it's
   affecting my health and relationships."
   ```
4. Click stop button
5. Wait for processing

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Transcription appears
- ‚úÖ Tags extracted (e.g., "work", "stress", "work-life balance")
- ‚úÖ Coach response generated
- ‚úÖ **Routing info displayed** showing:
  - Life Area: "work"
  - Coach: "Work Coach"
  - Mode: "restoration" (if work score < 30) or "unknown" or "play"
  - Area Score: displayed with color-coded bar
- ‚úÖ Session saved to database

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, life_area_id, area_score, coach_mode, created_at
FROM wisdom_coach_sessions
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM coach_sessions_extended
WHERE session_id = 'SESSION_ID_FROM_ABOVE';
```

---

### Test 2: Life Area Classification (Work)

- Life Area: `romantic-intimacy`
- Coach: "Intimacy Coach"
- Mode: "play" (likely high score)
- Relationship Context: Should detect partner mention

and I can't seem to save anything. I feel anxious and ashamed about my financial
situation. I don't know where to start."
```

**Expected Routing:**

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Edition manifest not found"
**Solution**: Ensure `EDITION` env var is set or use default
```bash
export EDITION=coach
```

### Issue 2: Coach Factory routing returns null
**Possible Causes:**
- Migration not applied
- Coach configs not seeded
- API endpoint not accessible
- OpenAI API key missing

**Debug:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coach_factory_config;  -- Should return 30
```

### Issue 3: Mode always shows "unknown"
**Cause**: Score is between 30-39 (transitional zone)
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Test with scores < 30 or ‚â• 40.

### Issue 4: Supabase client import error
**Solution**: Use correct import path:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'  // Server components
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'  // Client components
```
