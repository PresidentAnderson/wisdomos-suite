Don't try to fix everything at once. Focus on one red area.

### Be Honest
The dashboard only works if you're truthful about your assessments.

### Celebrate Wins
Every green area is a victory. Acknowledge your progress.

### Embrace the Cycle
Ashes are not failures‚Äîthey're opportunities for rebirth.

### Daily Practice
5 minutes a day beats 2 hours once a month.
