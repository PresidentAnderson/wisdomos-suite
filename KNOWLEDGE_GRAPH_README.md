## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **3D Rendering**: react-force-graph-3d, Three.js
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, text-embedding-3-small, Whisper
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with Prisma ORM
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime (prepared)
- **Voice**: Simple-peer WebRTC (to be integrated)
- **State**: Zustand + localStorage
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

### Data Flow
1. User creates autobiography entry or coach session
2. Tags are extracted and stored
3. Clustering API fetches all tags for user
4. GPT-4o-mini groups tags into 5-8 clusters
5. Embeddings calculate semantic similarity
6. Co-occurrence analysis builds relationships
7. Graph nodes and edges stored in database
8. 3D visualization renders force-directed layout
9. User interacts with graph (click, hover, search)
10. Export/import for backup and portability

### Cost Optimization
- **Caching**: 24-hour cluster cache prevents redundant AI calls
- **Rate Limiting**: 5-minute cooldown on theme merging
- **Batch Processing**: Max 100 tags per clustering request
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on-demand
- **Embeddings**: Small model (text-embedding-3-small) for cost efficiency

### Database Performance
- Indexes on:
  - `user_id + source_type` (fast user queries)
  - `user_id + last_seen_at` (temporal filtering)
  - `tags` (GIN index for array search)
  - `source_tag + target_tag` (relationship lookups)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Auto-cleanup for expired sessions

## Usage

### Generating Initial Clusters
1. Navigate to `/knowledge-graph/autobiography` or `/knowledge-graph/coach`
2. Click "Regenerate Themes" button
3. Wait for AI clustering (5-10 seconds)
4. Explore 3D graph with clusters and tags

### Interacting with Graph
- **Focus**: Click any node to zoom camera
- **Reset**: Double-click background
