## Life Areas & Coaching

### What are life areas?

Life areas represent the important dimensions of your life where you want to track progress and receive coaching. Common examples:
- Health & Vitality
- Intimate Partnership
- Career & Purpose
- Family & Friends
- Personal Growth

You define your own areas and commitments for each.

### How do AI coaches work?

Each life area has a dedicated AI coach that:
- Understands your specific commitment for that area
- Remembers your conversation history
- Asks clarifying questions
- Suggests experiments and actions
- Helps you identify patterns

Coaches are available 24/7 and conversations are unlimited.

### Are the coaches real people or AI?

The coaches are AI-powered, built on advanced language models and trained on the WE2/WE3 coaching framework. They provide consistent, evidence-based coaching at a fraction of the cost of human coaches.

### Can I customize my coaches?

Yes! Plus tier and above allow you to customize coach context with:
- Your background and situation
- Specific goals or challenges
- Preferred coaching style
- Focus areas

### How is this different from ChatGPT?

While ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI, WisdomOS coaches:
- Maintain persistent context for each life area
- Are trained specifically on WE2/WE3 coaching methodology
- Integrate with your signal data and assessments
- Track your progress over time
- Provide structured frameworks, not generic advice

## WE2 Assessments

### What is WE2?

WE2 is an evidence-based framework for assessing relational capability (not feelings) developed over 30+ years of coaching practice. It measures four dimensions:
- **Relatedness:** Connection and belonging
- **Workability:** Getting things done together
- **Reliability:** Keeping promises and commitments
- **Openness:** Transparency and vulnerability

### How do I use WE2 assessments?

1. Select a life area
2. Enter the person's name
3. Choose weekend number (2-5, from WE2 training)
4. Rate each dimension 0-5
5. Save - overall score is auto-calculated

### Do I need WE2 training to use assessments?

No, but understanding the framework helps. We provide:
- In-app guidance on each dimension
- Tutorial videos
- Recommended reading
- Optional WE2 workshop partnerships

### What do the scores mean?

- **0-2:** Restoration mode (work on basics: requests, promises, boundaries)
- **3:** Functional but room for improvement
- **4-5:** Play mode (experiment and grow together)

### How often should I assess relationships?

- **Monthly:** Key relationships
- **Quarterly:** Important but stable relationships
- **Before/after:** Important conversations or events
- **Ongoing:** Track progress over time (90-day averages)

## Signals & Tracking

### What are signals?

Signals are daily measurements of your fulfillment in specific dimensions of each life area, rated 0-5. Examples:
- Health: vitality (4.2), strength (3.8), energy (4.5)
- Partnership: connection (4.0), intimacy (3.5)
- Career: satisfaction (3.2), impact (4.1)

### How often should I record signals?

Daily is ideal for tracking trends. The dashboard shows 30-day rolling averages, so consistent daily tracking provides the most insights.

### What if I miss a day?

No problem! Just pick up where you left off. The system doesn't penalize gaps - it simply shows trends based on available data.

### Can I enter signals for past days?

Not currently, but this is a frequently requested feature on our roadmap.

### How many dimensions should I track per area?

Start with 1-3 key dimensions per area. Too many creates tracking fatigue. You can always add more as you build the habit.
