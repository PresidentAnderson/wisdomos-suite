# WisdomOS 2026 — Getting Started Guide

## Your First 15 Minutes with WisdomOS

Welcome! This quick-start guide will get you up and running in just 15 minutes.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Profile (2 minutes)

After signing up:

1. **Add your name** - This personalizes your experience
2. **Set timezone** - Ensures accurate signal timestamps
3. **Choose avatar** - Upload a photo or select an icon
4. **Notification preferences** - Daily reminders, weekly summaries

## Step 2: Create Your First Life Area (3 minutes)

Think of one area of your life you want to focus on.

**Example: Health & Vitality**

1. Click **"Add Life Area"**
2. Enter name: `Health & Vitality`
3. Enter slug: `health-vitality`
4. Write commitment: `I am vibrant, energized, and physically capable`
5. Click **"Add + Coach"**

**Your AI coach is now created!** It understands your commitment and is ready to support you.

## Step 3: Talk to Your Coach (5 minutes)

Start a conversation with your new coach:

**Try asking:**
- "What should I focus on this week?"
- "I want to exercise more but struggle with motivation"
- "Help me design an experiment for better sleep"

**Your coach will:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Help you identify what you really want
- Suggest concrete experiments
- Hold you accountable to commitments

**Save insights** that resonate with you - they'll automatically be added to your autobiography.

## Step 4: Record Your First Signal (3 minutes)

Signals track your daily fulfillment.

**For your Health & Vitality area, try:**

1. Click **"Quick Signal Entry"**
2. Select: `Health & Vitality`
3. Dimension key: `vitality`
4. Value: Rate 0-5 (how vital/energized do you feel today?)
5. Note: Optional context (e.g., "Slept 8 hours, felt great")
6. Click **"Save"**

**Record 1-3 dimensions per area daily.** After 30 days, you'll see powerful trends.

## Step 5: Explore Your Dashboard (2 minutes)

Click **"Fulfillment Dashboard"** to see:

- Your signal averages (will populate after a few days)
- Assessment scores (after you complete WE2 assessments)
- Last update timestamps
- Trends over time

**Initially empty?** That's normal! It fills in as you use the platform.

## Quick Tips for Success

### Make It a Habit
- Set a daily reminder for signal entry (8 PM works well)
- Block 10 minutes in your calendar
- Pair with existing habit (e.g., after dinner)

### Be Honest
- This is for you, not for show
- Low scores are opportunities for growth
- Coaches don't judge - they help

### Start Small
- Don't try to track everything at once
- 3 life areas × 2 dimensions = 6 daily signals
- Build from there as you get comfortable

### Use Your Coaches
- Talk to them like real coaches
- Ask for help when stuck
- Request experiments to try
- Report back on what worked
