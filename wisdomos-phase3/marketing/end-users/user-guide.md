- Monthly for key relationships

- To track relationship progress over time

**Understanding scores:**
- **0-2:** Restoration mode needed (work on basics)
- **3:** Functional but room for improvement
- **4-5:** Play mode (experiment and grow)

Signals are daily measurements of your fulfillment in each life dimension.
