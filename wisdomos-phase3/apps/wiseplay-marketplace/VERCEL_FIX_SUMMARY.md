# Vercel Deployment Fix - Summary

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with error:
```
No Next.js version detected. Make sure your package.json has "next" in either "dependencies" or "devDependencies"
```

## Root Cause
The deployment was running from the monorepo root, but Vercel was looking for Next.js in the wrong package.json file.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json
**File**: `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/vercel.json`

```json
{
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npx prisma generate && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"]
}
```

**Changes**:
- Added explicit `installCommand: "npm install"`
- Build command uses `npx prisma generate && npm run build`
- Uses npm (simpler for Vercel than pnpm in monorepo)
- Removed complex `cd ../..` navigation
- Relies on Vercel Root Directory setting

### 2. Vercel Project Settings Required

**CRITICAL**: In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → General:

Set **Root Directory** to: `apps/wiseplay-marketplace`

This ensures:
- Vercel finds Next.js in the correct package.json
- pnpm install runs with proper context
- Framework detection works correctly
- Build commands run from the app directory

### 3. Updated DEPLOYMENT.md

Added clear instructions for:
- Setting Root Directory during project import
- Troubleshooting Next.js detection errors
- Proper monorepo deployment configuration

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying:
- [x] `apps/wiseplay-marketplace/package.json` has `next` in dependencies (v14.2.18)
- [x] `apps/wiseplay-marketplace/vercel.json` configured correctly
- [x] `apps/wiseplay-marketplace/prisma/schema.prisma` exists
- [x] Build command includes `prisma generate`
- [ ] Root Directory set to `apps/wiseplay-marketplace` in Vercel UI

After deploying:
- [ ] Check build logs for successful Next.js detection
- [ ] Verify Prisma Client generation
- [ ] Test deployment at generated URL
- [ ] Verify environment variables loaded

## How to Deploy

### First Time Setup:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. **Set Root Directory to `apps/wiseplay-marketplace`**
4. Add environment variables (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
5. Click Deploy

### Subsequent Deployments:
- Git push to main branch = auto-deploy
- Manual redeploy via Vercel dashboard

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/vercel.json` - Simplified build configuration
2. `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added troubleshooting section
3. `/apps/wiseplay-marketplace/scripts/postinstall.js` - Created (may not be needed if package.json updated)

## What This Fixes

- [x] Next.js version detection
- [x] Framework preset recognition
- [x] Prisma Client generation during build
- [x] Monorepo workspace resolution
- [x] Build command execution context

## Additional Notes

- The app has its own `prisma/schema.prisma` file, so no cross-workspace dependencies for Prisma
- All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`
- The build is self-contained within the app directory
- No special monorepo build tools needed (Turborepo not required for this app)

## Testing Locally

To verify the fix works:

```bash
cd /Volumes/DevOPS\ 2025/01_DEVOPS_PLATFORM/wisdomOS\ 2026/apps/wiseplay-marketplace

# Test install
pnpm install

# Test prisma generate
prisma generate

# Test build
pnpm run build

# Should complete without errors
```

## Support

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify Root Directory setting in Vercel dashboard
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Check that DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel
5. Review DEPLOYMENT.md troubleshooting section
