## Usage Examples

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Setup database
./scripts-organized/setup/setup-database.sh

# 2. Setup Supabase
./scripts-organized/setup/setup-supabase.sh

# 3. Configure secrets
./scripts-organized/setup/setup-secrets.sh

# 4. Run tests to verify
./scripts-organized/testing/run-tests.sh
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run tests before commit
./scripts-organized/testing/run-tests.sh

# Deploy to Vercel
./scripts-organized/deployment/deploy-vercel.sh
```

### Repository Management

```bash
# Initialize new repos
./scripts-organized/git/initialize-empty-repos.sh

# Setup GitHub
./scripts-organized/git/github-setup.sh
```

---

## Making Scripts Executable

If a script is not executable, run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts-organized/category/script-name.sh
```

Or make all scripts executable:

```bash
find scripts-organized -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```

---

## Script Permissions

All scripts should have execute permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`). Check permissions:

```bash
ls -la scripts-organized/**/*.sh
```

---

## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts:

1. **Choose the right category:**
   - `deployment/` - Deployment and release scripts
   - `setup/` - First-time setup and configuration
   - `migration/` - Data or code migration scripts
   - `testing/` - Test execution scripts
   - `git/` - Git and repository management

2. **Follow naming conventions:**
   - Use kebab-case: `my-script-name.sh`
   - Use descriptive names: `setup-postgres.sh` not `db.sh`

3. **Add documentation:**
   - Update this README with script details
   - Add comments in the script file
   - Include usage instructions

4. **Make executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts-organized/category/new-script.sh
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Many scripts require environment variables. Common variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...

# Deployment
VERCEL_TOKEN=...
VERCEL_ORG_ID=...
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=...

# GitHub
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

Store these in `.env` file (never commit to git!).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Not Found
```bash
# Ensure you're in project root
cd /Volumes/DevOps/01-active-projects/wisdomOS 2025

# Use relative path
./scripts-organized/category/script.sh
```

### Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x scripts-organized/category/script.sh
```

### Environment Variables Missing
```bash
# Check if .env exists
ls -la .env

# Run setup-secrets.sh
./scripts-organized/setup/setup-secrets.sh
```

---

## Safety Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before running any script:**
1. Read the script to understand what it does
2. Ensure you have required permissions
3. Back up important data
4. Test in development first
5. Never run scripts from untrusted sources

üîí **Security:**
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Limit script permissions to what's needed

---

## Maintenance

These scripts should be reviewed and updated:
- After major platform updates
- When dependencies change
- During migration or restructuring
- When adding new infrastructure
