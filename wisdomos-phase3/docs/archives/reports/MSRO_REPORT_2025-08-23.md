## 🚧 Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
1. **Database URL**: Need production database credentials
2. **API Keys**: Awaiting production API keys for Deepgram
3. **Domain**: Production domain not yet configured

### Dependencies
- DevOps team for database provisioning
- Security team for secret rotation
- Product team for priority clarification

### Mitigation Plans
- Use development database temporarily
- Continue with mock API responses
- Deploy to Vercel subdomain for now

## 💡 Highlights & Concerns

### 🌟 Wins
- Feature delivered ahead of schedule
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- Excellent documentation created

### ⚠️ Concerns
1. **Security Risk**: Current password hashing not production-ready
2. **Scale Risk**: No caching layer for high traffic
3. **Data Risk**: No backup strategy in place
4. **Performance Risk**: Missing query optimization

### 🔍 Technical Debt
- Missing proper bcrypt implementation
- No message queue for async operations
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- Lack of performance monitoring
