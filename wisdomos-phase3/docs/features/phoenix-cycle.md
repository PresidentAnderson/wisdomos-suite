# The Phoenix Cycle

The Phoenix Cycle is WisdomOS's core transformation methodology, inspired by the mythical phoenix that rises from its own ashes.

## Four Phases

### 1. Ashes (Reflection)
**Purpose**: Acknowledge breakdowns and identify patterns

**Activities**:
- Journal upsets and challenges
- Identify recurring patterns
- Recognize unfulfilled commitments
- Assess life area status (red zones)

**Outcome**: Clarity on what's not working

### 2. Fire (Breakthrough)
**Purpose**: Transform perspective through reframing

**Activities**:
- AI-powered upset analysis
- Reframing questions
- Breakthrough conversations
- New commitments created

**Outcome**: New possibilities and commitments

### 3. Rebirth (Fulfillment)
**Purpose**: Track progress and transformation

**Activities**:
- Dashboard monitoring
- Commitment tracking
- Milestone completion
- Status changes (red → yellow → green)

**Outcome**: Visible transformation

### 4. Flight (Legacy)
**Purpose**: Archive wisdom and share insights

**Activities**:
- Export transformation journey
- Share insights with community
- Contribute to others
- Create lasting legacy

**Outcome**: Wisdom preserved and shared

## Using the Cycle

1. Start with a red or yellow life area
2. Journal about the breakdown (Ashes)
3. Answer reframing questions (Fire)
4. Create and track commitments (Rebirth)
5. Archive your journey (Flight)
