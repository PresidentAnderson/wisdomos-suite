# Contributions & Fulfillment

Track what you're giving to each life area with the contribution-fulfillment mirror system.

## Contribution System

### What is a Contribution?

A contribution is something you're actively giving to a life area:
- **Work**: Leading a project, mentoring
- **Health**: Daily exercise, meal prep
- **Relationships**: Quality time, active listening
- **Finance**: Budgeting, investing

### Creating Contributions

1. Navigate to a life area
2. Click "Add Contribution"
3. Describe what you're contributing
4. Set frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
5. Track progress

### Contribution Types

- **Ongoing**: Continuous contributions (e.g., daily meditation)
- **Project**: Time-bound contributions (e.g., finish course)
- **Milestone**: One-time contributions (e.g., resolve conflict)

## Fulfillment Mirror

The fulfillment mirror automatically reflects contributions across related life areas.

### How It Works

When you contribute to one area, WisdomOS identifies how it fulfills other areas:

**Example**: Contributing to Health
- **Work**: More energy, better focus
- **Relationships**: Better mood, more presence
- **Emotional**: Improved regulation

### Automatic Mirroring

WisdomOS uses AI to:
1. Detect cross-area impacts
2. Suggest fulfillment connections
3. Track ripple effects
4. Visualize contribution network
